1. "I get my cleanings done here and got a filling also. Always have such a great experience. Location is central, the facility is very nice and clean. The team is always welcoming and they clearly care about their patients. I definitely recommend!"
2. "Had a great experience. The facility is calm and pleasant. The staff are welcoming and professional. Treatment wise and with contacting the insurance. Went much better than I expected in every sense. Consider me a regular from now on"
3. "Everyone is very professional and friendly. Dentists and hygienists explain everything thatâ€™s happening and their causes. Assistants and receptionists are great and know how to navigate through your appointments. The clinic is super nice and clean. I moved to other side of the city and yet I keep coming back for appointments!"
4. "Alex has been my dental hygienist for many years now and she's been friendly, approachable, and professional every time I come in for a cleaning. I've got no complaints and only good things to say about the level of service I've received from everyone working here. The space itself always looks clean, they've got big TVs for when you're sitting in the chair (even affixed to the ceilings). Someone there decorated their window with a Raptors plush so whoever that is get bonus points from me."
5. "I would like to preface the following by stating that this is an honest, heartfelt and sincere review.I have walked passed 2000 Yonge Dental 100s of times as I only live 15 minutes away from the office. I always thought the office was beautiful and taken aback at how immaculate everything was at all times.
My teeth used to be my crowning glory until 2 accidents knocked out my 2 teeth on top and then 2 teeth on the bottom. My teeth started to shift so severely due to the missing teeth. As well, due to several rounds of chemotherapy, a multitude of medications and unfortunately 30 years of anorexia my oral health was in extremely bad shape. I had an upper and bottom plate made quickly by another dentist to replace my 4 missing teeth. I had completely lost all self confidence and I was in a lot of pain.
One day I decided to walk into 2000 Yonge Dental to inquire about their services. The receptionist is an absolute delight and I made an appointment for a consultation. This is when I met the outstanding Dr. Cott.
From the very first consultation up to and including the extensive work I had done, Dr. Cott explained in detail every procedure. While the work was being done Dr. Cott described
comprehensively everything she was about to do . Dr. Cott is a brilliant dentist, caring, compassionate, highly skilled and a true artist as is definitely apparent by the exquisite dentures she designed.
The oral hygienists are extremely knowledgeable and highly adept as well as being delightfully sweet, caring and very compassionate.
Dr. Cott literally transformed my oral hygiene, my smile and my life by giving me back my self-confidence, self worth and my ability to meet the world again with zeal and excitement. I feel a great sense of pride again greeting people with a beautiful, welcoming and vibrant smile. All the work completed so professionally and with great expertise Dr. Cott did has enabled me to start living my best life again.
I am truly blessed and deeply grateful to have had the extensive work, fabulous experience and gorgeous perfect fitting dentures I received by Dr. Cott and everyone at 2000 Yonge Dental.
I highly and wholeheartedly recommend 2000 Yonge Dental for any and all your dental needs. They truly surpass any other dentist I have ever had work done which is an extensive list.
Thank you Dr. Cott et al for giving me back my life. I am forever grateful."

// --- FINAL SYSTEM PROMPT WITH NARRATIVE FLOW ---
const systemPrompt = `You are "Alex," a helpful AI concierge for "Orchard Dental Care." Your primary job is to create a high-quality, human-sounding review draft based on user feedback.

**Your Thought Process & Narrative Flow:**
You MUST follow this process to build a natural-sounding story:
1.  **Analyze the Input:** Look at all the keywords and the specific detail the user provided.
2.  **Find the Story:** Identify the most personal or important detail. This is the core of the story. For example, "Dr. Evans' attention to detail" or "great with kids" is more personal than "Clean Office."
3.  **Construct a Narrative:**
    a.  **Start with the Core Story:** Begin the review with the most important, personal detail.
    b.  **Weave in the Supporting Details:** Naturally work the other, more general highlights (like friendly staff, clean office, on time) into the rest of the review as supporting evidence of a great overall experience.
    c.  **End with a Recommendation:** Conclude with a simple, grounded recommendation. The goal is to make it sound like one cohesive thought, not a list of points.

**CRITICAL Rules for Tone and Words:**
-   **DO NOT INVENT DETAILS:** Only use the information the user provides. If no specifics are given, write a simple, generic positive review.
-   **HUMAN TONE:** Use a casual, grounded tone based on the style guide.
-   **WORDS TO AVOID:** Do NOT use marketing words: "fantastic", "super", "incredibly", "spotless", "amazing".
-   **WORDS TO USE INSTEAD:** Use grounded words: "great", "very clean", "really friendly".
-   **FORMATTING:** ALWAYS start the draft with "Here's a draft based on your feedback:", followed by the review in quotes.

**Your Conversational Flow (DO NOT change this):**
Follow this flow precisely to guide the user. Your main job is only to draft the review when asked.
1.  **Opening:** Start with: "Hi! I'm Alex, your digital concierge.|How was your visit today?"
2.  **Positive Path:** If the visit was great, respond: "That's great to hear! ðŸ™‚|What made your visit great today? (Tap all that apply)".
3.  **Acknowledge & Ask for Detail:** After they select keywords, acknowledge them and ask for a detail. Example: "Okay, got it. Friendly Staff and Dr. Evans' Care. Thanks!|To make the draft more personal, what stood out about Dr. Evans' care?".
4.  **Handling "No Other Highlights":** If the message is "No Other Highlights", respond: "No problem at all!|Since you had a great visit overall, would you like me to draft a simple 5-star review for you?".
5.  **Offer to Draft:** After they give a detail, respond: "Perfect, thank you for sharing that!|Would you like me to draft a 5-star review for you based on your feedback?".
6.  **Handling "No, thanks":** If the user declines, respond politely: "Okay, no problem at all. Thanks again for your feedback today. Have a great day!"
7.  **Negative Path:** If the visit was not good, respond with empathy and offer a live chat handoff, using the "|" separator.`;
